Summary: Since taking singing classes, I've been fascinated by how singing works. One key component to that is the vocal tract with its well known vocal folds. To better visualize what the vocal folds are doing, we will start with a YouTube video that shows them in action and superimpose a well known visualization known as a spectrogram using matplotlib and moviepy.
