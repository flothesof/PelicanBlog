##Florian LE BOURDAIS

I'm currently a research engineer at [CEA](http://www.cea.fr/english-portal), the French atomic energy commission, originally created by Charles De Gaulle to engineer the French atomic bomb, but nowadays a government-funded research organisation involved in anything from fundamental research to applied technology with a heavy emphasis on R&D for nuclear energy generation.

I work in the Non-Destructive Testing department on the Saclay (near Paris) research center. My work topics concern mostly ultrasound based inspection methods, with a focus on phased array transducers, guided waves and EMATs. I studied mechanical engineering at the [École des Ponts ParisTech](http://www.enpc.fr/). Before working at CEA, I had the amazing opportunity to spend two years in Japan, where I learned to live and love the Japanese culture.

You can find my open-source contributions on Github: <https://github.com/flothesof>.

I sometimes like to solve problems proposed by Project Euler. You can see my current badge below:
