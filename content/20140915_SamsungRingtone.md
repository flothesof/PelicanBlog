Summary: What would you do in Korea where everyone uses the same Samsung ringtone on their smartphone if you wanted to stand out and be original? I say: butcher it, chop it to pieces and make a nice new sound out of it.

**Update October 1, 2014**: I made a YouTube video from the content of this post! You can find more details about how I made the video using the great Python movie library MoviePy in the [dedicated repository](https://github.com/flothesof/TheRingtoneVariations).
