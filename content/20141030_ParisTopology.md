Summary: In this post we use the elevation API provided by Google to obtain some height information about the Paris area and build a 3D model from the data using the OpenSCAD language. The result can be brought to the physical world using a 3D printer.

**Update November 3, 2014**: I printed the model using an Ultimaker. You can find it on [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:530054). Here's what it looks like when printed.
