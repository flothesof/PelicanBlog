Summary: I’ve been recently refreshing my finite element skills and found a fun problem that appears when working with 2D meshes made of triangles. The problem is as follows: "Given any 2D triangle T defined by its vertices, can I map it to a reference triangle with vertices (0, 0), (1, 0) and (0, 1)?".
